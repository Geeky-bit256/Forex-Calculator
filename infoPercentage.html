	<p>When calculating the percentage of profit you've made, it's essential to exclude your initial deposit from the calculation. This ensures that you're measuring the return on your investment accurately.</p>
	
	<p>For instance, let's say you deposit <b>R1,000</b> and you've made a profit of <b>R10,000</b>. To calculate the percentage return, you would divide the profit (<b>R10,000</b>) by the deposit (<b>R1,000</b>), which gives you a return of <b>900%</b>. This means that your investment has grown by <b>900%</b> of its original value.</p>
	<p>It's worth noting that if you include your initial deposit in the calculation, the percentage return would be <b>1,000%</b>. However, this would be misleading, as it would imply that your investment has grown by <b>1,000%</b>of its original value, rather than <b>900%</b>.</p>
	<p>By excluding your deposit from the calculation, you get a more accurate picture of your investment's performance and can make informed decisions about future investments.</p>
